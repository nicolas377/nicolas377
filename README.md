<h2 align="center">Hey there!</h2>

<p align="center">I'm Nick, a high school developer located in South Carolina. I make stupid things happen. (sometimes)</p>

- I started out modding GeoFS, an online flight simulator.
- I'm getting back into TypeScript with an old project of mine (its the pinned one if you want to check it out)
- I also maintain [extension-cli](https://github.com/MobileFirstLLC/extension-cli), and a few packages on [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).
- I'm inbetween semesters at the moment, so I'll be contributing a good bit until I start spring semester.
