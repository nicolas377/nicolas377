<h2 align="center">Hey there!</h2>

<p align="center">I'm Nick, a CS major at Clemson. I make stupid things happen. (sometimes)</p>

- I started out modding GeoFS, an online flight simulator.
- I currently maintain [extension-cli](https://github.com/MobileFirstLLC/extension-cli), and a few packages on [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).
- I don't really do a lot of development at the moment, but I will occasionally check my notifications for pings.
