<h2 align="center">Hey there!</h2>

<p align="center">I'm Nick, a CS major at Clemson. I make stupid things happen. (sometimes)</p>

- I started out modding GeoFS, an online flight simulator. I moved through several passion projects through late middle school into early high school. Eventually I started [GeoFS Plugins](https://github.com/GeoFS-Extensions/autoland) before moving on during the second half of high school.
- I'm currently a computer science student at Clemson, and while I'm currently bogged down in theory for the spring semester, this coming summer I'll be looking to start a project.
- I currently maintain a few packages on [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).
- As I mentioned, and while I mostly just do code reviews, I will occasionally check my notifications for pings.
