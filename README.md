<h2 align="center">Hey there!</h2>

<p align="center">I'm Nicolas, a high school developer located in South Carolina. I make stupid things happen. (sometimes)</p>

- My biggest project is [GeoFS Plugins](https://github.com/GeoFS-Extensions/autoland). I work on it with a team of 3 other people from around the world.
- I also maintain [extension-cli](https://github.com/MobileFirstLLC/extension-cli), and a few packages on [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).
- You can reach me on Discord at `nicolas.#1913`.
